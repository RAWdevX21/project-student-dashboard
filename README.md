# iReact Student Dashboard!

This dashboard project is a breadcrumb in my journey learning React JS at Pursuit. Built from scratch, this tool is designed to help manage and track student progress. I have highlighted some of the features below.

## Deep Dive Into New Discovery

### Action Panel
I've implemented various action utilities in the top banner. It's got a handy search bar, a theme switcher for a bit of personalization, and options to add new students or cohorts. There's also a calendar and a support link, just in case.

### Quick Stats
Here you'll find some key metrics like the total number of students, number of cohorts, and average CodeWars score. You can filter these stats and download them too.

### Student Profiles
I've made it easy to get to know your students. Each profile has a thumbnail image and all the details you need.

### Reporting and Analytics
I've included some tools to help you keep track of student progress. You can monitor their status and see how they're doing over time.

### Communication Tools
Stay connected with built-in messaging and commenting features. It's all about keeping the conversation going.

### And More!
There's more to discover, like resource links, a student success section, and a contact form in the footer. I've tried to think of everything you might need.

## Getting Started
To start using the dashboard, you'll need to install and set it up on your machine. I'll guide you through the process.

## How to Use
Once you've got everything set up, I've got a handy guide to help you navigate and make the most of all the features.
